Welcome to PyNmap v1.1. This tool is built for anyone who may or may not have had any past experiences with Nmap. However, when using this tool make sure you use it on a Linux OS e.g (Ubuntu, Kali Linux, CentOS, Fedora, etc) and not Windows. It allows anyone to scan their network and find useful information, they might not have known prior to the use of this tool. This tool also has 14 different types of scans that anyone can easily run and also has an option to save the results to a file for later use. To download this tool, you need to make sure you have Python 3.8 and Nmap installed onto your computer. You then need to cd into the PyNmap directory and execute the source code file as root. ENJOY!
